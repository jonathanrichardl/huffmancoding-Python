# huffmancoding-Python
This repository contains one encode script and one decode script. The encode script will generate the huffman table and export it to table.txt, and encode the following string with bitwise operation, and then export it to compresed.bin.The decode function generates the huffman tree from the available huffman table in table.txt, and then proceeds to decode the byte file to the original string. Compatible with C# Huffman Coding code in my repositiory (the encoded file here can be decoded with the C# code, and vice versa.)
